# Yale Program on Climate Change Communication (YPCCC)

Global warming is one of the greatest threats – and opportunities – of the 21st century. Our fate will be determined by the choices of 7.4 billion people and counting. We are social scientists studying the causes and consequences of public opinion and behavior. We help governments, media, companies, and advocates communicate more effectively. 

One of several YPCCC projects, the “Yale Climate Opinion Maps” (YCOM) allow users to visualize and explore differences in public opinion about global warming in the United States in unprecedented geographic detail.

This version of the Yale Climate Opinion Maps is based on data through spring 2020. Public opinion about global warming is an important influence on decision making about policies to reduce global warming or prepare for the impacts, but American opinions vary widely depending on where people live. So why would we rely on just one national number to understand public responses to climate change at the state and local levels? Public opinion polling is generally done at the national level, because local level polling is very costly and time intensive. Our team of scientists, however, has developed a geographic and statistical model to downscale national public opinion results to the state, congressional district, and county levels. We can now estimate public opinion across the country and a rich picture of the diversity of Americans’ beliefs, attitudes, and policy support is revealed.
